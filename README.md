This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites
- NodeJs >= v14
- Yarn
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## The Challenge.

- Please clone this repo into your machine. 
- Make sure to do the steps mentioned in Getting Started section and you have the app running on port 3000 and you can see a list of recipes.
- We leverage the open [The Meal DB rest api](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to use as backend. 
- Tasks:
    - Change the list of recipes UI on the main page to cards as per this mockup [Link](https://ibb.co/2MfVZJv) (*Bonus*: use Material - UI)
    - Add action on the cards so that when you click on any card you will be redirected to a detailed page as per this mockup [Link](https://ibb.co/sJRf54w)

- Once you have done the code changes, please create a new branch in the format `name_recipe_challenge` to the repo and create a PR and share it back with the team. 

## Things which can add value to your submission.
- Deploy the app and share the preview URL. 
- Add search functionality to search the recipes. 
- Add screenshots when raising the PR. 
- Make sure your commit messages are concise and precise. Have many atomic commits rather one single large commit.
